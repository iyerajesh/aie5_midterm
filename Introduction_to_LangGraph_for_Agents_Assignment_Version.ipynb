        "### Why Cycles?\n",
        "\n",
        "In essence, we can think of a cycle in our graph as a more robust and customizable loop. It allows us to keep our application agent-forward while still giving the powerful functionality of traditional loops.\n",
        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

I thought that A40 and A100 GPUs were close enough, and optimized for A40s, but they are very different. A100 performance is now 40% faster with a small hit for other GPUs.\"\\n\\n2. **Artidoro Pagnoni**:\\n   - [Tweet](https://twitter.com/ArtidoroPagnoni/status/1661438274894966784): \"Thank you to @Tim_Dettmers @universeinanegg @LukeZettlemoyer and the many people who made this project possible!

              "\"RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) that combines retrieval-based methods with generative models to improve the quality and accuracy of generated text. Here's a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, relevant documents or pieces of information are retrieved from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model that identifies the most relevant documents based on the input query or context.\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to a generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, a generative model, such as a transformer-based language model, uses the augmented input to generate a response or piece of text. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and accurate outputs.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model needs to produce responses based on a large and diverse set of information, such as in open-domain question answering or conversational AI. By combining retrieval and generation, RAG models can leverage both the precision of retrieval systems and the flexibility of generative models.\""

It involves adding low-rank matrices to the frozen original model, which significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters and the GPU memory required for training. This method is particularly useful for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) like GPT-2 and GPT-3, as it maintains model quality while improving training efficiency and throughput. LoRA is part of the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) framework and can be implemented using libraries like Loralib in Python.

            "Prompt engineering is the process of designing inputs for generative artificial intelligence (AI) models to deliver useful, accurate, and relevant responses. It is primarily used with large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini. The goal is to optimize the output from these models by crafting well-engineered prompts, which can lead to improved results and efficiency. This practice is crucial in fields such as customer support, content generation, and data analysis, where minimizing bias and maximizing relevance in AI outputs are essential.

            "The history of prompt engineering is intertwined with the evolution of natural language processing (NLP) and AI. It traces back to early language models and information retrieval systems, evolving significantly with advancements in reinforcement learning and the introduction of attention mechanisms. The development of large language models like GPT-3 marked a significant milestone, as these models demonstrated the ability to process information and generate human-quality text. Prompt engineering has continually evolved to enhance language understanding, generation, and controllability, addressing issues like exposure bias and biases in generated text.

This involves adjusting and training the model on a new dataset, typically for a related task. Fine-tuning can be done on the entire neural network or just a subset of its layers, with the non-fine-tuned layers being \"frozen\" during backpropagation. This technique is a part of transfer learning and is used to improve the model's performance on specific tasks by making small adjustments to its parameters.\n",
